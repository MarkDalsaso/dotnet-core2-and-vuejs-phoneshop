# dotnet-core2-and-vuejs-phoneshop
This repository is based on the follow-along app (named "ECommerce" or "PhoneShop") used in the Packt book "ASP.NET Core 2 and Vue.js", authored by Stuart Ratcliff. The code is updated with the latest dependencies, required mod's, comments (prefixed with 'NOTE: MRD') to help others get it working and minimize frustration, etc.

## More Info
This is not a fork of [the author's repo](https://github.com/sturatcliffe/ASP.NET-Core-2-and-Vue.js). Instead, it's based on the [original Packt download](https://www.packtpub.com/support). I did this because I didn't want to cheat on sorting out trickier bits and bugs.

Most commits are by chapter.

Note that the scaffolding used for this project is based on the older, (now archived)
[Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaTemplates](https://github.com/aspnet/javascriptservices); now maintained 
at [AspNetCore](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore).

## Now there are even more options for dotnet scaffolding of Core + Vue.js.

I'll list them as I find them
* [TrilonIO/aspnetcore-Vue-starter](https://github.com/TrilonIO/aspnetcore-Vue-starter) looks super promising.
