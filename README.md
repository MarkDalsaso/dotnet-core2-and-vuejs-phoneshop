# dotnet-core2-and-vuejs-phoneshop
This repository is based on the follow-along app (named "ECommerce" or "PhoneShop") used in the Packt book "ASP.NET Core 2 and Vue.js", authored by Stuart Ratcliff. The code is updated with the latest dependencies, required mod's, comments (prefixed with 'NOTE: MRD') to help others get it working and minimize frustration, etc.!

## More Info
This is not a fork of 
<a href="https://github.com/sturatcliffe/ASP.NET-Core-2-and-Vue.js" target="_blank">the author's repo</a>. 
I wanted to work out the details myself, as an exercise in understanding the not so obvious nuances of this 
solution (web application) stack. Rather, this repo is based on the original download at https://www.packtpub.com/support, 
and stands alone in that respect.

Most commits are by chapter.
