# dotnet-core2-and-vuejs-phoneshop
This repository is based on the follow-along app (named "ECommerce" or "PhoneShop") used in the Packt book "ASP.NET Core 2 and Vue.js", authored by Stuart Ratcliff. The code is updated with the latest dependencies, required mod's, comments (prefixed with 'NOTE: MRD') to help others get it working and minimize frustration, et cetera.

## More Info
This is not a fork of [the author's repo](https://github.com/sturatcliffe/ASP.NET-Core-2-and-Vue.js).
 
I wanted to work out the details myself, as an exercise in understanding the not so obvious nuances of this 
solution (web app) stack. Rather, this repo is based on the [original Packt download](https://www.packtpub.com/support), and stands alone in that respect.

Most commits are by chapter.

Note that the scaffolding used for this project is based on the older, (now archived)
[Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaTemplates](https://github.com/aspnet/javascriptservices); now maintained 
at [AspNetCore](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore).

Now there are even more options for dotnet scaffolding of Core + Vue.js. I'll try to list them as I find them [TrilonIO/aspnetcore-Vue-starter](https://github.com/TrilonIO/aspnetcore-Vue-starter) looks super promising.
